# Decision Making Practice #1
# Using the variables num1 and num2, which are fed with user input (just like in the provided code), create a flow control structure that compares the values of the variables, and returns a result according to the case:

# "num1 is greater than num2"

# "num2 is greater than num1"

# "num1 and num2 are equal"

# You must display the value of the user input instead of num1 and num2.
# num1 = input("Enter a number:")
# num2 = input("Enter another number:")

# f"{num1} is greater than {num2}"
# "num2 is greater than num1"
# "num1 and num2 are equal"


# Decision Making Practice #2
# The laws of a certain country establish that an adult can drive if they are of legal age (18 years or older), and have a driver's license.

# Create a conditional structure to check if a 16-year-old without a license can drive, and display the corresponding result on the screen:

# "You can drive"

# "You can't drive yet. You must be 18 years old and have a license"

# "You can't drive. You need to have a license"

# Use the code base already provided to set up the appropriate flow control structure and check those conditions.
age = 16

"You can drive"

"You can't drive yet. You must be 18 years old and have a license"

"You can't drive. You need to have a license"

# Decision Making Practice #3
# To access a certain job, the candidate must be able to program in Python and speak French.

# Create a conditional structure to evaluate a candidate given these conditions, and display the corresponding message on the screen:

# "You meet the requirements to apply"

# "To apply, you need to know how to program in Python and speak French"

# "To apply, you need to speak French"

# "To apply, you need to know how to program in Python"

# Use the code already provided to set up the appropriate flow control structure and check those conditions. Evaluate a candidate who knows French, but does not know how to program in Python.

# Decision Making Practice #4
# Enter your name

#what is iteration?
#what are for loops?


# For Loops Practice #1
# Using For loops, greet all members of a class, printing "Hello" + their name.

# For example: "Hello Norville"

students = ["Norville", "Fred", "Velma", "Daphne"]




# For Loops Practice #2
# Given the following list of numbers, calculate the sum of all the numbers using For loops and store the result of the sum in a variable called sum_numbers:

list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]
# sum_numbers = 





# For Loops Practice #3
# Given the following list of numbers, perform the sum of all even and odd* numbers separately in the variables sum_even and sum_odd respectively:

list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]

# *Recall from previous days: the modulus (or remainder) of a number divided by 2 is zero when said value is even, and 1 when it is odd

# num % 2 == 0 (even values)

# num % 2 == 1 (odd values)

list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]

# sum_even = 

# sum_odd = 




########################################loops############################################################
# while Loops
# The while statement in Python is one of most general ways to perform iteration. A while statement will repeatedly execute a single statement or group of statements as long as the condition is true. The reason it is called a 'loop' is because the code statements are looped through over and over again until the condition is no longer met.

# The general format of a while loop is:

# while condition:
#     code statements
# else:
#     final code statements

# so a while loop is basically a way for python to loop through code several times until a condtion is met
# Letâ€™s look at a few simple while loops in action.
#queue video about loops
i = 1
while i < 10:
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
  # or i += 1

print("done with loop")


# we can use a while loop to continually ask the user to guess a word until they guess it correctly
# secret_word ="giraffe"
# guess= ""

# while guess != secret_word:
#   guess = input("enter a guess: ")

# print("you win")


# While Loops Practice #1
# Create a While Loop that prints the numbers 10 to 0 on the screen, one at a time.

number = 10



# While Loops Practice #2
# Create a While Loop that subtracts one by one the numbers from 50 to 0 (both numbers included) with the following additional conditions:

# If the number is divisible by 5, show that number on the screen (remember that here you can use the modulus operation dividing by 5 and checking the remainder!)

# If the number is not divisible by 5, continue executing the loop without showing the value on the screen (don't forget to continue subtracting so that the program doesn't run infinitely).

number = 50



# Loop Interruption Statements Practice
# Create a For loop through the following list of numbers, printing each of its elements to the screen, and interrupt the flow when you find a negative value:

# list_numbers = [4,5,8,7,6,9,8,2,4,5,7,1,9,5,6,-1,-5,6,-6,-4,-3]

# You must not change the order of the list.

list_numbers = [4,5,8,7,6,9,8,2,4,5,7,1,9,5,6,-1,-5,6,-6,-4,-3]




##############################dictionaries and loops##############################################
#We've been learning about sequences in Python but now we're going to switch gears and learn about mappings in Python. If you're familiar with other languages you can think of these Dictionaries as hash tables.

# This section will serve as a brief introduction to dictionaries and consist of:

# 1.) Constructing a Dictionary
# 2.) Accessing objects from a dictionary
# 3.) Nesting Dictionaries
# 4.) Basic Dictionary Methods

# So what are mappings? Mappings are a collection of objects that are stored by a key, unlike a sequence that stored objects by their relative position. This is an important distinction, since mappings won't retain order since they have objects defined by a key.

# A Python dictionary consists of a key and then an associated value. That value can be almost any Python object.


#sample dictionary
monthConversions = {
    "JAN" : "January",
    "Feb" : "February",
    "Mar" : "March",
    "Apr" : "April",
    "May" : "May",
    "Jun": "June",
    "Jul" : "July",
    "Aug" : "August",
    "Sep" : "September",
    "Oct"  : "October"

}
print(monthConversions["Sep"])
#add more months
monthConversions['Nov'] ="November"
monthConversions['Dec'] = "December"
print(monthConversions)
#print(monthConversions.keys())
# so structure of a dictionary
 #is the title of the dictionary = {"key": "value"}

# challenge 1
#how do we get data from our dictionary?
# test for understanding
#create a dictionary filled with your favorite actors and movies.
#call the dictionary favActors_Movies
# call the dictionary twice finding at least two movies









##############################ranges#####################################################

# Range Practice #1
# Create a list consisting of all the numbers from 2500 to 2585 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.



# Range Practice #2
# Using the range() function, create in a single line of code a list consisting of all numbers that are multiples of 3 from 3 to 300 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.



# Range Practice #3
# Use the range() function and a loop to add the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 15 (inclusive). Store the result in a variable called sum_squares.



# For this purpose:

# Create a range of values that you can iterate through in a loop

# For each of these values, find its squared value (power of 2). You may need to create intermediate variables (optionally).

# Sum all the squared values obtained. Accumulate the sum in the variable sum_squares.
